## Welcome to DBType

Welcome to the **DBType Research Group** at the [Universit√† degli Studi della Basilicata](https://unibas.it/).

The DBType group explores foundational and applied aspects at the intersection of **databases** and **type theory**.

We study topics at the intersection of **databases**, **type theory**, and **formal methods**, aiming to build robust and expressive data systems.

Our interests include:
- Typed query languages
- Schema inference
- Semistructured data, with particular emphasys on JSON and JSON Schema
- Unstructured data, with particular emphasis on data coming from the medical domain
