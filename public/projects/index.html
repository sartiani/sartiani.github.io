<p><strong>&ldquo;BioConceptum: AI-based semantic analysis of Italian radiology reports related to oncological diseases&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>The objective of BioCONCEPTUM is to research and develop an AI-powered tool to analyze medical radiology reports related to the screening of oncological disorders, within a case-study of hundreds of Italian RMI reports on colorectal cancer, as provided by the clinical partners of the consortium (Gemelli and San Raffaele hospitals). This will be done via a combination of statistical NLP, language-dependent corpora and models, and the latest developments in neural networks, in order to achieve both a significant advancement of biomedical NLP tools and bring about a semantically-indexed repository of radiology reports, to be effectively browsed and queried via a flexible interface by medical doctors within Tumor Board discussions and help them in diagnosis and treatment. BioCONCEPTUM will semantically analyze the MRI narratives and extract disease information and findings for patient and disease surveillance, including tumor characteristics, anatomical labels, organ measurements and descriptors (shape, size, etc.) and medical assessments (benignity/malignity, etc.). Such information will also be associated with relevant entities from biomedical repositories, including the National Cancer Institute Thesaurus, the Radiology Gamuts Ontology, etc. Machine-learning models like transformers and self-attention mechanisms will also be exploited to enhance the analysis of the tool, by fine-tuning them on past radiology reports and biomedical repositories. The latter will be accessed, analyzed and integrated both for training the models and for providing a cohesive semantic representation of the extracted information.</p>
